# Midterm Project – DevOps Deployment

Welcome to the **Midterm DevOps Project** repository for DeployNova!  
This project showcases a Python-based application containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and ECR.

---

## 🧩 Project Overview

- **Topic**: Contact Manager
- **Language**: Python
- **Architecture**: Modular (`main.py` + `functions.py`)
- **Interface**: Flask-based web UI
- **Storage**: In-memory using Python dictionaries/lists
- **Features**:
  - Add / Edit / Delete / Display entries
  - Sort and calculate based on stored data
  - Web interface through Flask

## 🐳 Docker Configuration

### Dockerfile

Ubuntu-based image that installs Flask, sets the working directory, and runs the app on port 8080.

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["python", "app/main.py"]
```

### Flask Run Command

Your Flask app must start like this to work in Elastic Beanstalk:

```python
app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)
```

## 🚀 AWS Deployment (Manual via Console)

### 1. AWS ECR

- Created a private repository in **Elastic Container Registry**: `midterm-proj`
- Built and pushed the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t midterm-proj .
docker tag midterm-proj:latest 495307862605.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/midterm-proj:latest
docker push 495307862605.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/midterm-proj:latest
```

---

### 2. Elastic Beanstalk (EB)

- Chose deployment via **AWS Console**
- Platform: **Docker running on 64bit Amazon Linux 2**
- Configuration Preset: **Single instance (free tier eligible)**
- Deployed using a `Dockerrun.aws.json` file zipped alone in a `.zip`

#### 📄 Dockerrun.aws.json

```json
{
  "AWSEBDockerrunVersion": 1,
  "Image": {
    "Name": "495307862605.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/midterm-proj:latest",
    "Update": "true"
  },
  "Ports": [
    {
      "ContainerPort": 8080
    }
  ]
}
```

- Uploaded via **Upload and Deploy**
- Resulting public URL:
  ```
  http://<your-environment>.elasticbeanstalk.com
  ```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned

- ❌ Attempting "High Availability" failed due to IAM sandbox limits on Auto Scaling
- ✅ Switching to **Single Instance** solved the issue
- ❌ Initial 503 errors appeared due to Flask listening on port 5000 instead of 8080
- ✅ Fixed by:
  - Updating Flask to listen on `port=8080`
  - Rebuilding Docker image
  - Using correct `Dockerrun.aws.json`
- ❌ EB errors about version = 3 fixed by using `"AWSEBDockerrunVersion": 1`

---

## ✅ Final Deliverables

- ✅ Python app with modular logic
- ✅ Web UI using Flask
- ✅ Dockerized (with Dockerfile)
- ✅ Image pushed to AWS ECR
- ✅ Successfully deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk
